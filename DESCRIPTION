Description: Functions for cleaning and summarising water quality data for use in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Service (NPDES) permit reasonable potential analyses and water quality-based effluent limitation calculations. Procedures are based on those contained in the "Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control", United States Environmental Protection Agency (1991).
